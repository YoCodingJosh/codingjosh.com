As a generalist software engineer, I thrive on versatility and adaptability. I pride myself on being a jack of all trades, capable of handling frontend, backend, native apps for desktop and mobile, and even dipping into light DevOps and system administration tasks. If there's something I don't know, you can bet I'll pick it up swiftly!
